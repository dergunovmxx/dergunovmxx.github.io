      <p><a>The premechanical age is recognized as that period between 3000 BC and AD 1450. The communication between human beings was through the use of those early languages but there were also others who communicated by using picture drawings which later became known as petroglyphs, and the primary surface for these pictures was rock. This led to the early development of the Phoenician alphabet. As alphabets became more popluar and more people were writing information down, pens and paper began to be developed. It started off as just marks in wet clay, but later paper was created out of papyrus plant. The most popular kind of paper made was probably by the Chinese who made paper from rags.</a></p>
      <img src = "images/11.jpg">
      <p><a>Now that people were writing a lot of information down they needed ways to keep it all in permanent storage. This is where the first books and libraries are developed. You’ve probably heard of Egyptian scrolls which were popular ways of writing down information to save. Some groups of people were actually binding paper together into a book-like form.</a></p>
      <img src = "images/12.jpg">
      <p><a>Also during this period were the first numbering systems. Around 100A.D. was when the first 1-9 system was created by people from India. However, it wasn’t until 875A.D. (775 years later) that the number 0 was invented. And yes now that numbers were created, people wanted stuff to do with them so they created calculators. A calculator was the very first sign of an information processor. The popular model of that time was the abacus.</a></p>
