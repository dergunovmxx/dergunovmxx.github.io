      <p><a> This is the age in which we are living now and it started in 1940 with the creation of the first computer. One of the first fully functional computer systems was the ENIAC and this was the first high-speed digital computer. What made it special was the fact that it could be programmed to solve a whole range of complicated computing problems. This system was specifically designed for the U.S. Army for artillery firing tables. This was also a huge machine which required 680 feet and it had a total weight of 30 tons.</a></p>

      <p><a>When it comes to the age of digital computing there are four stages of development. The first systems relied upon vacuum tubes and punch cards in systems such as the Mark I (Mark One) and the ENIAC. During this time storage of information was accomplished through the use of rotating magnetic drums. Eventually, transistors replaced vacuum tubes while magnetic tape was used in the place of punch cards. Things started to change when programming languages such as COBOL and FORTRAN were developed.</a></p>
      <img src = "images/42.jpg" >
      <p><a>Eventually, integrated circuits took the place of transistors and metal oxide semiconductors became the preferred media for information storage. This led to the first actual operating system and the more advanced programming language known as Basic. And eventually, the final stage of information technology was reached as we know it today when modern CPUs emerged which combined control circuits and memory on a single chip. This led to the personal computer and eventually the modern graphical user interface.</a></p>
