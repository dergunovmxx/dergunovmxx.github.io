    <h2>The Mechanical Age</h2>

      <p><a>This is the stage where we finally start to see some correlation between the first forms of information technology and the systems which are currently in use. History places the mechanical age between 1450 and 1840. It was during this time that a substantial number of new technologies emerged and the interest in these kinds of technologies increased accordingly.</a></p>
      
      <p><a>The slide rule was one of the inventions of this time which is basically a primitive analog computer which could be used for multiplication and division. Other technologies such as the Pascaline was invented by Pascal and this also was very popular during this time as a kind of mechanical computer. A little later another technology emerged, which was known as the difference engine which was a creation of Charles Babbage.</a></p>
      <img src = "images/21.jpg">
      <p><a>Several interesting machines were invented during this time and although none of these were nearly as effective as our modern-day computers this was still a very important part of the evolution process of information technology. Another problem with ancient machines was the fact that they were very large in relation with their usability but to the people living at that time they were extraordinary inventions.</a></p>
      <img src = "images/22.jpg" >
      <p><a>There were lots of different machines created during this era and while we have not yet gottent to a machine that can do more than one type of calculation in one, like our modern-day calculators, we are still learning about how all of our all-in-one machines started. Also, if you look at the size of the machines invented in this time compared to the power behind them it seems (to us) absolutely ridiculous to understand why anybody would want to use them, but to the people living in that time ALL of thse inventions were HUGE.</a></p>
