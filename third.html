      <p><a>It is during this stage of information technology that we start to see some resemblance of the technologies which have become available to us in the last couple of decades. History places the electromechanical age between 1840 and 1940. Telecommunication emerged out of those early inventions and soon after that the first telegraph was created. The man Samuel Morse was responsible for the Morse code in the early 1830s. Shortly thereafter the telephone was invented which is still a popular means of communication in our day. In the late 1800s the first radio was designed and manufactured and all of these things were important stepping stones that sped up the emergence of new technologies which eventually evolved into the information technology systems we have today.</a></p>

      <p><a>Howard University eventually created the first digital computer in the US in 1940. But even though it was a groundbreaking event, this was a giant project because this computer was 50 feet long, 8 feet high, 2 feet wide and it weighed 50 tons. It was operated through the use of punch cards and it was nothing like our modern computers. However, this first attempt generated a lot of interest and many people soon started to investigate ways in how to make this system smaller.</a></p>
      <img src = "images/32.jpg" >
      <p><a>That era lots of machine invented and while we have not yet gotten to a machine that can do more than one type of calculation in one, like as modern-day calculators, we are still gathered information about how all of our all-in-one machines started. Also, if you look at the size of the machines invented time means when the machine started (to us) absolutely ridiculous to understand why anybody would want to use them, but that time those machine make their life easier and help to collect information.</a></p>
